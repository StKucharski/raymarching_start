# raymarching_start

This repository contains a simple opengl setup that I used to see what raymarching really is and how it works

the template directory
  three major files: 
    main.cpp -- an opengl program that compiles and runs shader.frag shader file 
    shader.frag -- it implements raymarching and sdf
    run.sh -- one liner in bash that compiles and runs the program

template program:

the env_01 directory is a direct copy of template directory with a different shader.frag
env_01 program:

REQUIREMENTS
The setup is made for linux and requires opengl packages and its prerequisites
