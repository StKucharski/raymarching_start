# raymarching_start

This repository contains a simple opengl setup that I used to see what raymarching really is and how it works

the template directory has three major files main.cpp which is an opengl program that compiles and runs shader.frag shader file which is the second major file, it implements raymarching and sdf functions . The last major file is run.sh which is a one liner in bash that compiles and runs the program

the env_01 directory is a direct copy of template directory with a different shader.frag
